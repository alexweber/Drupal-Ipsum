This is the repository for the showcase website

* Requires Drupal 7.0+
* Download: [http://drupal.org/project/drupal_ipsum](http://drupal.org/project/drupal_ipsum)

## Demo website Readme

This demo-site is peculiar for a number of reasons - apart from showing off the awesome new Drupal Ipsum module, the general idea was to create as minimalistic a Drupal 7 site as possible with as few core modules enabled as possible.
This was done purely as an experimentation/learning exercise and 0 (zero) pandas were injured in the process.
